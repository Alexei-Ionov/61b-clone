You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I was proud of the simplicity and readibility of the majority of my code (excluding the iterator and equals method).

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I felt like my Equals method for both my arrayDeque and LinkedListDeque was inelegant.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: I learned that there are multiple ways to implement the code, some which I would have never thought of.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: That I wasn't the only one super confused on it.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would probably keep it the same.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Similar to the ArrayDeque I was proud of my readibiilty and easy-to-understand code.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Again, my iterator and Equals method were very inelegant.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: I learned that there were different, yet still very similar ways, to implement this Deque.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: I would use the java visualizer to get a better understanding of it before actually tackling the code.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would keep it the same, but change my Equals method to make it keep it shorter (in a good way) and easier to read.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: Was fine, nothing should be changed.
